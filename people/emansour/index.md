Dr. [Essam Mansour](http://emansour.com/) has been a Senior Software Engineer at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) since June 2013. Dr. Mansour is a member of the QCRI Distributed Systems group. He is working on the [Crosscloud project](/projects/crosscloud) for re-decentralizing the web and leading the development of a collaborative data management system based on RDF graphs. The Crosscloud project is a collaboration with [Prof. Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) at MIT. Dr. Mansour is also leading a research project for advanced query processing over decentralized RDF graphs with [Prof. Panos Kalnis](http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/PanosKalnis/) at KAUST. He worked in the [e-store](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2735514) project, an elastic in-memory OLTP system applied to [H-Store](http://hstore.cs.brown.edu/). This project was a collaboration with [Prof. Michael Stonebraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker) at MIT.

Before joining QCRI, Dr. Essam Mansour was a research fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) working with [Prof. Panos Kalnis](http://web.kaust.edu.sa/faculty/PanosKalnis/). At KAUST, Dr. Mansour led a project for developing a framework for a cloud-based string database system. The project aimed to bridge the gap between Big Data analytics and cloud computing.
Dr. Mansour has developed different parallel string algorithms, such as maximal pairs and motif extraction. His system utilizes multi-core systems, clusters and supercomputers. Compared to recent methods, his system can expect much faster execution while supporting 2-3 orders of magnitude more data than existing methods. Moreover, his system reports scalability up to 16,384 cores on a supercomputer. 

Dr. Mansour delivered a complete course in Cloud Computing at KAUST. Additionally, he offered different lectures on advanced data management for KAUST students.
