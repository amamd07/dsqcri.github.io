## Motivation 
- Resource sharing everywhere 
- Data centers, cloud instances, clusters, servers 
- Hardware resources over provisioned and underutilized

1. Applications have diverse resource usage patterns 
2. Cache sensitivity 
3. Memory access rate 
4. Working set size

## Approach
- Run-time workload profiling
- Hardware cache partitioning as characterization tool 
- Multi-dimensional resource usage pattern 
- Memory bandwidth at varied LLC allocation 
- IPC (Instructions Per Cycle) at varied LLC allocation 
- Memory reference rate 
- Resource-aware workload placement 
- Coordinating cache and bandwidth sharing 
- Cache partitioning on top of scheduling
