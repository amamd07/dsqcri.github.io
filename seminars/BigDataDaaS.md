## Massive Processing and Mining of Big Data on DaaS-based Cloud

### Speaker:

[Fatos Xhafa]()

### Abstract:

Big Data has become a big player in the current knowledge-based systems in various forms of Business Intelligence and Analytics. The premise is that by processing and mining large data sets, the actors of the system (managers, leaders, analysts, etc.)  can make more informed decisions and predictions, often in (almost) real-time. However, this comes to the price of processing and mining huge amounts of data under time and cost restrictions.
 
In this talk we will address some emerging issues in massive processing and mining of Big Data. Such issues comprise, on the one hand, the  need for distributed data mining (distributed machine learning, in a broader scope). Indeed, most existing machine learning algorithms are
designed under the assumption that data can fit into RAM and can be fast accessed, while disk-level machine learning is slow. On the other hand, with ever increasing size of data sets, distributed machine learning algorithms face the burden of data pre-load and data communication, which could well be larger than the proper data processing time.
 
We will discuss how such issues can be approached under the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)-based Cloud model, where data-locality and data-aware scheduling (namely, computing services are scheduled on the same or nearby computing resources)  are essential to design new algorithms for both massive processing and mining of Big Data.
