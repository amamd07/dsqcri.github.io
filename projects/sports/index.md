## Overview

Sport, and football especially, is a one of the most popular recreation and entertainment industry in the world. For example, millions are playing football on a daily basis, while the television coverage of the leading European football leagues reaches hundreds of millions transforming these matches into worldwide events. By nature, sport is a multi-disciplinary area that involves areas such as sport science, medicine, biomechanics, nutrition science, etc. Recently, computer science is starting to have a significant impact on sports with the help of ever-increasing data on sports. These _datasets_ allow a thorough, _quantitative analysis_ of every facet of sports: from _evaluating the individual performance_ of the players through the _players’ involvement in the team efforts_ to the _automatic analysis of the strategy_ of the teams.

The goal of our sport analytics project is to develop algorithms, methods, and procedures to __quantify and predict the performance and strategies of players, teams__. We believe our research efforts will have an impact on the whole sport industry including amateurs, professional teams, and the media.

Qatar, e.g., by hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2022, made a long-term commitment to sports, and its local and global development. As such, it is a perfect location to establish a _global hub for sport analytics_.

The benefit of a data-driven, automated analysis of football is twofold. First, football analytics is able to provide _objective_ and _quantitative evaluation_ of the performance of players and teams. This could support the decision making of the technical teams of football clubs. Second, analytics is able to _scale up and out_, i.e., a team can automatically analyze any number of matches in a short period of time without any geographical restrictions (contrary to the limited time an analyst/scouts have).

There are three main areas where __football analytics__ could have an impact on a club: a) analyzing and preparing for the next opponent, b) improving the skills of the club’s players with customized training programs based on the players’ match-day performance, c) identifying potential new players who would fit into the style and strategy of the team.



## qScout

qScout is a _quantitative football player scouting system_ developed by QCRI. It provides advanced, cutting-edge metrics to evaluate the performance of the players, to estimate how a player would fit in a team, and to predict the future potential of football players.

### Passing Style

### Recurring Pass Patterns

### Speed and Movements of Players
