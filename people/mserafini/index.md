About you

### Research Focus
At QCRI, Marco works on the scalability, dependability, and consistency of large-scale distributed systems. Current projects include elastic large-scale database back-ends, masking the inconsistencies that arise in weakly-replicated systems running OLTP workloads, and principled approaches to detect hardware data corruption errors and in particular, Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC) errors.


### Previous Experience
Prior to joining QCRI, Marco worked at Yahoo! Research in Barcelona where he studied the problem of protecting large scale distributed systems from hardware data corruption, which is becoming more and more frequent in the newest generation of CPUs. Unreliable commodity servers are typically used to store data that is critical from an infrastructure viewpoint (e.g., configuration metadata), personal viewpoint (e.g., emails), or financial viewpoint (e.g., ad clicks and billing information). Critical systems like Google's Mesa, for example, detect corruption errors through application-specific replication techniques. Marco proposed a new formal model for Arbitrary State Corruption (ASC), which captures the essential aspects of data corruption faults in an application-independent manner. He used the model to develop PASC, a runtime library that can provably detect data corruption errors in any event-based distributed system without using replication.

Marco also worked on the formal analysis of the Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast (Zab) protocol and introduced the notion of barrier to determine the essential difference between active replication protocols like Paxos, which exchange operations, and passive ones like Zab, which exchange state updates.

Finally, he developed social piggybacking, a technique to increase the throughput of social event feed systems by identifying central users that can relay information across neighborhoods. 

Marco received his PhD at TU Darmstadt. His thesis introduced the concept of Eventual Linearizability, a correctness condition for systems that are usually strongly consistent and degrade consistency only when necessary. It also introduced Scrooge, a fast Byzantine fault tolerant algorithm running on a small set of replicas.
