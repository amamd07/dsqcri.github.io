# Introduction
This page includes open source multimedia related datasets released by QCRI.

# Reflection Dataset

### About the dataset
This is a work-in-progress dataset that contains videos of reflections. We define reflections as scenes that contain two distinct textures over each other. The videos are mainly between 4 to 7 seconds in length and span a wide variety of categories. The videos include tags that define different categories and rough annotations to localize the reflection in the video.

### Uses of this dataset
Uses include testing reflection detection, localization and removing algorithms. This dataset is also big enough to help in training deep learning networks.
