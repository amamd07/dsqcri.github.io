# Getting Started
This repo holds the QCRI's DS website. Under the main directory, each user has a folder that can be populated with their profile to give the public more information about what we do. The folder is under /people/. If you are not a site administrator, please read along to learn how to pull your folder locally for editing.

## Team members
