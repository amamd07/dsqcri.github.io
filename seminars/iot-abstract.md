## Building an Open Stack for IoT

Abstract: The IoT vision is to make the world better connected and enable smarter interactions between devices, people, and everyday artifacts. The amount of investments and global efforts that have been put towards the realization of this vision is phenomenal. However, the IoT research community is highly fragmented and major players are advocating for their own version of IoT, creating proprietary stacks that merely provide vertical integration of existing technologies. Such a trend inhibits the wide adoption of IoT and creates discrepancies in operation rather than cooperation.
 
In this talk, I will highlight some of my efforts in creating a rapidly-deployable open stack for IoT that promotes interoperability and accelerates adoption of IoT. I will give an overview about the different layers of the stack then present my framework for leveraging cloud computing and cloudlets (aka Edge Computing) to support IoT devices to reduce the time required to deliver the end-to-end IoT scenarios, including best practices for interoperability and composability between cloud and edge architectures.
