## Exploring the new world of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality

### Speaker:

[Abdurrahman Ghanem]()

### Abstract:

Vividly I can remember peeking inside the TV as a kid looking for the people living inside and asking how I can see the back. Technology limitation flattened our 3D world to a plain, but the technology is finally ready to add the lost dimension back. Mixed reality adds 3D holograms to the environment projected into the retinas via light wave guides. HoloLens is untethered device requiring no external hardware to function. In this session we will explore the Hardware configuration, basic functionality, device capabilities, development tools, and potential applications and research with mixed reality and HoloLens.
