### Research Focus
- I am highly fascinated by the concept of Artificial Intelligence. I have always wanted to answer the question “Can we make machines more human?”. The deep neural networks are the closest formulation to the human brain, yet not as good as the human neuron system. I believe with enough data and great computational power (i.e GPUs or may be in the future quantam computers) computers can achieve human-level concept learning. I am interested in the area of computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning.
